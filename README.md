Whether you're running minigames, faction servers, or cooperative worlds, TeamChatPrefix makes it easy for players to identify each other’s team at a glance.

- Fully compatible with Bukkit, Spigot, Paper, and Purpur.
- Works out of the box — no configuration needed.

**Why use it?**  
Clear team-based chat formatting improves communication and immersion for players, making your server look and feel more professional.
